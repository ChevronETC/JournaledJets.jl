# JournaledJets.jl

This package contains distributed block operators and vectors for Jets.jl.  It
builds on top of the block operators in Jets.jl, providing a parallel distributed, fault tolerant version of block operators and block vectors that are used to orchestrate
distributed (in-memory) storage and compute.
